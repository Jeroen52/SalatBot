# SalatBot
The SalatBot is a chat bot application for the streaming platform Twitch.tv
running as a firefox plugin and allowing automation of simple moderation and
event organization tasks.  

Keep reading to learn some basics about chat bots and the speciality of the
SalatBot or read the
[manual](https://github.com/Salatfreak/SalatBot/wiki/Tutorial) to install and
configure the SalatBot (This will be done within a few minutes, I promise).

## Previous chat bots
### What is a chat bot?
A chat bot is a computer program that reads and writes to a chat room. But
instead of showing the messages to the user and waiting for him to type a
response, it analyzes incomming messages itself and uses certain filters and
patterns to find an appropriate response.  

It can be used to detect spam or offensive messages and take actions like
timing out or banning its sender or to offer automated answers to certain
commands or phrases. Another use case are little chat applications like polls
or raffles.  

Unfortunatelly such an automated chat participant can also be used to
manipulate or spam a chat room. For example it could crawl through the
channels of a certain game to spam them with advertisement for a specific
channel to gain viewers.

### Chat bots at Twitch.tv
In the chat rooms of twitch streams you can find hundreds and thousands of
people typing their comments to the show and discussing lively. Especially for
more popular streams a chat bot is a must have to control the chat flow,
answer frequently asked questions or to host polls and raffles.

### What differs the SalatBot from the previous chat bots?
The usual chat bot is running on a certain server in the internet, has to be
invited to your chat, being granted moderation permission and can mainly be
controlled by the channel owner himself.  

The SalatBot on the other hand can be used by everybody. The only thing you
need is a Twitch account and the firefox web browser since you are effectively
going to become the bot yourself. You will obviously not be able to timeout or
ban people without moderation permissions. But there are no restrictions to
viewer events, polls or automated answers.  

This makes it a valuable tool for
chat moderators to interactively control spam waves or take care of the
chat commands and events.

## What to do next?
Now that you know the basic idea of the SalatBot, you can go ahead and install
it into your firefox browsers by just a few clicks. Read the
[tutorial](https://github.com/Salatfreak/SalatBot/wiki/Tutorial) for further
information.
